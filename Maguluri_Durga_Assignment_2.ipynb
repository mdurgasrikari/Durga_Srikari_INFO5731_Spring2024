So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \\\"you just got Luigi'd\\\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.\",\n          \"I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.\",\n          \"We've all seen the crappy version of Chris Prats 'wahoo' mario attempt.However it was used as comic relief which was very much appreciated.Bowsers character held a lot of what we love about Jack Blacks personality.DK wasn't so much what we expect out of Seth Rogen, but considering it's PG, probably a good thing haha.In saying that we do get the laugh, yes you're welcome!Over all a very well rounded story line.

So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \\\"you just got Luigi'd\\\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.\",\n          \"I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen.

So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \\\"you just got Luigi'd\\\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.\",\n          \"I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.\",\n          \"We've all seen the crappy version of Chris Prats 'wahoo' mario attempt.However it was used as comic relief which was very much appreciated.Bowsers character held a lot of what we love about Jack Blacks personality.DK wasn't so much what we expect out of Seth Rogen, but considering it's PG, probably a good thing haha.In saying that we do get the laugh, yes you're welcome!Over all a very well rounded story line. I was personally a bit nervous about the movie being great but a shocker of an ending. Though not everyone will be happy with it, there is an opening with us wanting more.

So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \\\"you just got Luigi'd\\\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.\",\n          \"I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.\",\n          \"We've all seen the crappy version of Chris Prats 'wahoo' mario attempt.However it was used as comic relief which was very much appreciated.Bowsers character held a lot of what we love about Jack Blacks personality.DK wasn't so much what we expect out of Seth Rogen, but considering it's PG, probably a good thing haha.In saying that we do get the laugh, yes you're welcome!Over all a very well rounded story line. I was personally a bit nervous about the movie being great but a shocker of an ending. Though not everyone will be happy with it, there is an opening with us wanting more.

So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \\\"you just got Luigi'd\\\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.\",\n          \"I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.\",\n          \"We've all seen the crappy version of Chris Prats 'wahoo' mario attempt.However it was used as comic relief which was very much appreciated.Bowsers character held a lot of what we love about Jack Blacks personality.DK wasn't so much what we expect out of Seth Rogen, but considering it's PG, probably a good thing haha.In saying that we do get the laugh, yes you're welcome!Over all a very well rounded story line. I was personally a bit nervous about the movie being great but a shocker of an ending. Though not everyone will be happy with it, there is an opening with us wanting more.

So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \\\"you just got Luigi'd\\\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.\",\n          \"I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.\",\n          \"We've all seen the crappy version of Chris Prats 'wahoo' mario attempt.However it was used as comic relief which was very much appreciated.Bowsers character held a lot of what we love about Jack Blacks personality.DK wasn't so much what we expect out of Seth Rogen, but considering it's PG, probably a good thing haha.In saying that we do get the laugh, yes you're welcome!Over all a very well rounded story line. I was personally a bit nervous about the movie being great but a shocker of an ending. Though not everyone will be happy with it, there is an opening with us wanting more.

So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \\\"you just got Luigi'd\\\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.\",\n          \"I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.\",\n          \"We've all seen the crappy version of Chris Prats 'wahoo' mario attempt.However it was used as comic relief which was very much appreciated.Bowsers character held a lot of what we love about Jack Blacks personality.DK wasn't so much what we expect out of Seth Rogen, but considering it's PG, probably a good thing haha.In saying that we do get the laugh, yes you're welcome!Over all a very well rounded story line. I was personally a bit nervous about the movie being great but a shocker of an ending. Though not everyone will be happy with it, there is an opening with us wanting more. And it looks like we will get what we want.

So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the \\\"you just got Luigi'd\\\" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.\",\n          \"I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.\",\n          \"We've all seen the crappy version of Chris Prats 'wahoo' mario attempt.However it was used as comic relief which was very much appreciated.Bowsers character held a lot of what we love about Jack Blacks personality.DK wasn't so much what we expect out of Seth Rogen, but considering it's PG, probably a good thing haha.In saying that we do get the laugh, yes you're welcome!Over all a very well rounded story line.
