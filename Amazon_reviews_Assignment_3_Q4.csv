"This is a very stylish and functional product--fits the DX perfectly, is easy to open and close, offers protection for your Kindle, & feels good in the hands (kind of mat, rubbery feeling of the neoprene).  I love the look of it but my only reservation so far is that the surface of neoprene tends to show fingerprints after just a little handling.  Maybe that depends on the color you choose--I got it in red.  Otherwise,  very happy with it.",Positve
This product works as advertised. The buttons are a little hard to push for aging fingers but otherwise we are very pleased with the product.,Positve
The case is nice but did not have a glow light. I'm disappointed that the product didn't meet the advertisement.,Negative
"This product worked for about three minutes.  Sometimes would not turn on, and even then, only played songs one time, then stopped playing.  Also, not compatible with Rhapsody service.  I do not recommend.",Negative
"No power on the AC adapter. Tried several outlets. I confirmed that the USB cable worked. Just the wall adapter didn't. I'm returning it. May have to shell out for the Apple brand one, much as it hurts.",Negative
"I use this when I travel and it has charged my iPhone 5s, Nexus 2012/2013, Samsung 5s and others.  Sometimes hard to plug in  depending on the hotel",Positve
Well i was disappointed that i waited almost a full month to find out that it was lost in the mail and it was the only item in stock so i never received it. But was fully refunded right away once discovered.,Negative
Give it one star only because I recieved it in a timely fashion but other than that I was very dissatisfied !!!!! Unit did not work and had to be returned.,Negative
"I bought this a couple of years ago, and started off with no problem other than that the screen auto dimmer thing wasn't very effective.  Then more recently, a problem came up.  I tried to take out a CD that I had put in, and the CD player mechanism had broken.  I literally had to pry the thing open to get a CD out, then, of course, it was broken.  Thankfully the speakers were good, so I now have them on a new stereo accompanying other ones...  don't waste your money",Negative
"So far so good, it doesnt go as loud as I thought it would go, people will not hear you comming a mile away but it does sound pretty good for the price.",Positve
The cable was not compatible between my macbook and iphone.  Also the connector came apart and the cables started fraying.,Negative
I got this and a green one for my daughter's Ipod 4 and she adore's in. And it was very cheap. so its a win win.,Positve
"Considering the price and quality of this speaker, I would rate this 4 star compared with other 6.5\\"" speaker in the market. If you hook it up with the new generation H/U, it produces a decent bass if you're not  into a enclosed loud/amplified 12\\"" subwoofer or if you're over 50.",Positve
Finally received the cover after about a monrh. It fit just fine and the color was great.  Now I feel more secure in carrying the e-Reade since it's protected.,Positve
"The dash cam works great, but unlike some of the other  Mini 0801 Dash DVRs it doesn't write a separate data file with GPS information. The GPS data is only displayed on the screen. Some other cameras write a separate data file which allows the use of a mapping program to display the route along with the video. There may be someplace hidden where the separate file can be toggled on, but I have not found it.<br />As far for the camera.... It has pretty good color and image quality for something at this price point. The new 0803 cameras do have better vision in darker lighting conditions, but the 0801 does pretty good.<br />A tip in setting up dash cams is to point the camera a little lower than what you would think. This will help the camera's auto exposure to not underexpose as much and you will get better definition in darker areas, but may slightly overexpose the sky.",Positve
"at 500watts i expected it to be average 50watts rms..it is metal ,so  looked nice..but sounds like crap... sorry but i prefer to buy, pieso tweeter  than these . it did not sound clean....i don't use them...i do use, motorola,   seleniun,and audio pipe tweeters",Negative
Fast shipping but this product is very cheaply made I brought this for my grandchild so her IPod would be protected if it fell but this skin is not suitable for protection. It is only good for decoration. Therefore I rated it1*,Negative
Like others before me I was fooled by the initial customer reviews of this product.  They were either outright lies or placed by the product seller to generate sales.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  The only way I can describe it is that it adds a mirror finish to your kindle.    This product is going straight into my garbage can.  Full stop,Negative

"This is a basic case that is a good fit for my Garmin Nuvi 1350 LMT.  Just enough padding to protect the screen.  A little gimmicky to have it listed at 1 cent with $3 shipping, but a fair price overall.",Positve
"Hey, what can you say? It does the job alright, but the quality is terrible.<br />I figure it's not going to take very long for this to either break or stop working.<br />The price is rather steep for such a poor quality item.<br />I wouldn't buy another one of these, I'll look for better quality, but I'm not saying don't buy it... it does do the job.",Positve
Actually I have not yet figured out how to assemble the several parts. It almost seems too complex! No directions or schematic provided.,Neutral
"The decal fits well, haven't had too much trouble with the edges curling. The screen protector comes with one of those handy smoothing cards. The case is a tight fit, so don't plan on fitting anything beside paper in the pockets. Also, sometimes the straps press on the volume button when adjusting the Nook. Besides that, it completes its purpose, which is making my Nook look nice while its protected.",Positve
"Great for in car use, plus it works as a stand alone MP3 player!  You will need a 'tf' also none as a 'micro sd card' reader/writer (cheap, around $8).  Write you mp3's to the 'tf' or 'micro' sd card, insert into the cassette unit and insert into your car's Cassette player or your homes stereo system (great for taking to parties).  I've been able to use a 8gb card loaded with music and podcast mp3's.  Charges up in about 6 hours and has a remote to use in your car to switch tracks.",Positve
"It Reads Codes and lets you erase them.  It's a very basic model but does the job.  I've used it on both my Honda and Subaru and it diagnosed the problem.  This model just gives you the code which you then have to look up in a booklet supplied, a minor inconvenience. Instructions are a bit vague about how to erase codes but i figured it out quickly.",Positve
"It seemed like a great deal! But reality set in quick. Not the most user friendly mp3 player, doesn't have the option to lock buttons and  the mode button broke after only 1 week!!  Never again!! I'll get another Coby and pay a little more but they last A LOT longer!!",Negative
"This lasted about 45 days. The MP3 player never worked well-erased songs from my player when I hooked it up. But I wasn't overly concerned because I bought to play CD's. But after about 40days it wouldn't recognize CDRs and a week or so later it stopped recognizing CDs of any kind. I contacted the seller about the dud and ofcourse got nowhere because it was past the 30 day warranty. I tried to contact the manufaturer, but it cost more to ship than the item was worth. Garbage garbage garbage!!!!!",Negative
"The masque fits my iPhone 4S perfectly.  No complaints there.  It feels nice on the phone and after wasting one on a practice application, my second one went on just fine.  The package even came with masques for the front of the iPhone and masques for the back of the iPhone so you don't scratch the glass on the back.  Very nice.  The reason I'm leaving a 3 star review is the same reason some other people are a little unhappy with the product.  In low, oblique light, you get a weird vertical rainbow on your screen.  That's only when the phone screen is off.  Turn the screen on and you can't see the rainbows anymore.    Its NOT a deal-breaker for me, but for nearly $10, I wasn't expecting it.  The idea of a screen protector is to forget its there - whenever I see the rainbowing, it reminds me its still there.    I've only seen the rainbowing a few times and the lighting has to be juuuuuuust right.  Its hard to explain, but hopefully you know you'll still get a quality screen protector with one minor flaw...",Neutral
good sound even small size.,Positve
"Recieved my product fairly fast. I learned quickly that the extra cable it came with does not need to be used. The remote control looks fairly different that what pictured. It doesn't do any purpose because it doesn't work either. Overall, the music plays clear and it charges up my battery. You get what you pay for but it works well overall.",Positve
"This device is being sold under different names in the marketplace.  I bought a version at my local Radio Shack in preparation for an upcoming road trip.  From the moment that I picked up the box I was skeptical, and as it turns out I was right.  The box was so light I thought it was empty.  When I opened it up (before leaving the store to make sure it actually contained the product!) I saw that it indeed was there, but very lightweight.  Not wanting to judge, I took it home and installed it.      The good: it installed quickly and easily on my Acura MDX.      The bad: when I put the iPad in, it was immediately obvious that the mount arm is WAY too flimsy to support the weight of an iPad. I did not encounter slipping of the ball joint (that adjusts the angle) or the mounts to the headrest - those held.  However, the whole arm is very flimsy resulting in something that almost broke just by brushing it. The pad just flops around and the arm bends and wiggles like it is going to break.   And in terms of usability, the pad bounces around on the arm so much that on anything other than smooth interstate, my son cried out \\""Please turn it off!\\"".      This went back in the box and is going back to the store.  It's not worth $15, much less what it costs.",Negative
"These iPod skins are fun and colorful, though not perfect. For those of us old enough to remember when our entire music collection was on cassete tape, these skins are a reminder of our youth (or how old we have become, lol). They go on the iPod quite easily and make it easy to grip. There are 2 main drawbacks though:   1) In order to make the case look accurately like a cassete, the corners are squared off, which leaves space between the squared off edges of the case and the rounded backside of the iPod. When you try to press on the volume buttons the case almost comes off. I end up using the virtual volume slider on the display.  2) There is a cutout hole for the camera, speaker, and headphone jack, but no cutout for the 30 pin connector, so if you want to recharge or connect the iPod to an outside source you have to take the case off. Some may be put off by that, but currently I only have devices that connect to my iPod by the headphone jack, so the only time I need to take the case off is when I charge it or synch it with iTunes.",Positve
"I bought this for my sister, she likes the Dark Tower series books by Stephen King. She likes to put eBooks on it and listen to them while working. She likes it a lot, the only down side is it didn't start at the beginning so she had to keep pushing the - until it got to the beginning. Other than that she has not issues with it.",Positve
Would of gave it five stars but the Bluetooth for music plays really low you have to trun the volume up to max to hear it. Other then that I love it.,Positve
"For the most part I am pleased with this purchase. The wired sound quality is really good for the price. True story - I had it set up and playing from an Android phone in the living room. While I was out of the room, my wife needed to turn down the volume for a phone call. She went to the stereo system and was dumbfounded it was off. She seriously did not realize the sound was coming from this little device.<br /><br />I rated it just so-so however because there are random glitches in the playback from a memory card. Trying several different cards made no difference.",Neutral
"Built pretty well for the price. The arm is strong to hold up most phones and you can bend the arm to your liking. Transmitter works and I have clear reception ( in NYC/Jersey area ) . The socket is stable and hardly comes out . The remote is cheap ... so I just threw it out. no offense. It works on the Apple family , but not for phones with big screens... ( htc titans,galaxy s's, note's, etc) For the price and in need of aux transmission this product is a find!",Positve
"The cable keeps coming up with message that this accessory is not supported. I bought it specifically because I was led to believe that it was totally compatible with the iphone 5s. I am not able to charge the iphone either with these cables. II had to throw it in the trash. It is a waste of money,",Negative

"Great Unit for the money - Instructions are terrible.<br />Took me many efforts to try to find a format that works on the SD Cards.  Currently it only plays 4GB or lower SD cards.<br />To compress the videos to play - Use .avi (xvid Codec) Resolution 720 x 480 Frame Rate of 25 FPS<br />Bitrate 512000 - I use mp3 audio codec at nitrate of 128K, sample rate of 44,100<br />Nothing else works that I have tried.

"Got the case in the mail in a white envelope, no instructions.  I guess it's pretty self explanatory, but would be nice to have something, maybe installation tips?    Also, they included a little teal thing with a velcro strap and some web loops that I have no idea what it is for.  There is a little slot under the velcro strap so it appears that this item could be a storage pocket/protector for the earbuds?  I really don't know what it is for or how am I supposed to use it if it is an earbud holder.    Otherwise, the case and screen protector is pretty good.  The case is easy to put on and take off, however, the slots cut for the volume and on/off button are a little high making it slightly tricky to push the buttons.  They could be wider to make it easier but otherwise are ok.  I couldn't get the screen protector on without getting 2 tiny bubbles that would not scrape out.  For how cheap the protector probably is, they COULD throw in a spare in case some moron not quite as smart as me totally screws up the first one (I admit, I came pretty close).    All in all, good product for small $.  Website didn't have any help/instructions either.    UPDATE:  As I mentioned about being a partial moron above, I just re-read the product description for the case and it mentions a Nike pouch for your shoe.  I guess that's what the little unidentified thing that came with my case is.  Still no idea how to use it and after spending $270 on an Ipod, I can't afford Nike shoes.",Positve
This product failed to work in my Garmin. Garmin would not boot up. The old battery is now still in use with little holding power and fortunately still works.<br /><br />This replacement fails to work. I suspect some software is detecting a non-Garmin battery and prevents it from working...that's my theory. Don't Buy.,Negative
"OK, opened box to find antenna wire had apparently fatigued and broken off the circuit board in transit. Was stumped for a few minutes looking for where to re-solder it back on....finally noticed the spot where it had been soldered....on a very narrow sub-board that is at 90 degrees to the main board, it's the only sub-board and is easy to see. the antenna lead solders on to the round terminal near the end of the sub board, near a three-lead transistor. it was easy to re-solder and even easier to wire up to my Honda accord. The price is definitely right, the remote key fob is of excellent quality, the range works great even from 50 yards away...as far as I tested it, and I would buy again! Helps if you can get a detailed schematic of your power lock system from the net or alldata.com...you need to know if you have a ground trigger lock setup (usually) or a positive trigger system....the keyless entry can be wired up either way and will work fine with either type...they include a one-page schematic showing the different wiring methods for either type of lock trigger...takes a little head scratching but it isn't really rocket science. Overall a good, cheap keyless entry for those of us who have power locks but used to have to use a key in the door lock every time you wanted to lock or unlock the dang car....A nice relief to be DONE with all that manual key twisting! I didn't take the time to hook up the trunk lock wire or the park lights flash wire...just kept it simple with a hot wire, a ground, a lock signal wire and an unlock signal wire. Too easy to have waited so long to get around to this! The remotes were both already programmed to the board and I didn't have to program anything....the instruction sheet hinted that there was a white button on the circuit board that needed to be pushed to learn a new remote, but since both fobs were working fine, I didn't worry about that. $15 keyless entry? AWESOME!",Positve
"Nice looking.  A little cumbersome when using volume keys on side, but definately a good buy compared to what you see out there in the retail stores.",Positve

"This is a great case.  It fits on well and snugly and provides a bit of padding if the I-touch should have an unfortunate fall.  The only complaint I have about this product is that the headphone hole is difficult to use with anything but headphones.  I use RCA to audio jack connections in my car.  I have to pull the corner of the Itouch out of the case to make the audio jack connection, but I don't have to do this with the regular headphones I plug into it.     All in all, it's a good product.  I'd probably buy one again.",Positve

"These are great. I bought them at Christmas for my daughter and her 2 sons. Since they are 3 and 5 and like to watch different things these worked perfectly for them. They were easy to hook up, the headrest fit like they were made for the vehicle (Chevy Trailblazer). We liked the fact that they zipped up so no ne knows that they aren't just headrests. We liked everything about them. The only reason they got 4 star instead of 5 is one of the DVD player stopped working about 10 days after installing them. We sent that back but I just liked the quality of these so decided to replace with the same product as I know that some things are just flawed from the factory. Received the new ones (my return and refund from Amazon was as always easy and fast) my daughter  installed them and back to good. No problems at all and my grandsons loved that they were the same ones. Great buy. Great price!",Positve
Easy to deal with and good customer service. Overall the remoke was good and fit right but the blank key is a bad blank cut key thats why I only gave them 4 star instead of 5 star. I would order from them again if they can solve the straight cut on the blank key.,Positve
Makes for a great little gift that has very practical purpose.  Plenty enough sound for amplifying your iPod or computer when you're home.  I also tried it out when driving in the car and it just doesn't compete well with road noise.  But it is very handy and transportable and does a good job when you're in a situation where regular speakers are not available. Small enough and light enough to throw into your computer case for spur of the moment use.,Positve
"The case fits, protects very well, and is moderate to light weight.  I have had this for about a year now and find that it is convenient for holding a reading light and folded backwards (It snaps shut both as a cover and folded backwards) as a convenient method for fingers to hold the reader in bed. Only issue on mine is the reader is not as firmly held when new. Still very adequate.",Positve

"I'm happy with it. I bought the 8 gig card, cause I read the cam had trouble with the 16, and it works pretty good. I have a jeep wrangler, so I made a mount for it to ride on the roll bar, just beside and behind my left ear, So the cam not only see's what I see, it has a view of my speedometer, and if I flip down my visor with mirror, it then can also get a view of the tailgater behind. Now we were just on a recent trip, and on a couple of ocasions, I noticed it wasnt recoreding, and I got a reading, of card full, so after formating a couple times, I decided to lower the resolution, {smaller video size} and it seems to be fine now in overwriting when the card reaches capacity.",Positve
"Whats good: This unit fits perfectly into the ZX2 with no modifications. It comes with all wiring harnesses, including those for the rear defrost. It easily fits any radio as long as it is of standard size. The factory climate knobs fit, although it is a tight fit.  Whats not good: The plastic is made of the cheapest available material and feels like it will break in your hands; however, it is not noticeable once the unit is installed. The backlight for the climate controls looks absolutely terrible. There are just a few lights that unevenly supply backlighting. The overall design looks cheap after installation, but that can't be avoided if you want to use an aftermarket radio. The worst thing about this is... It's the only aftermarket radio kit available for the ZX2! I spent a lot of time trying to find different kits and I could not find any. If you want to put a new radio into your ZX2, this will have to work. I just think they could have done better.  Unrelated installation notes: You will need a radio antenna extender. The factory antenna connection is too short to hook up before sliding the radio in place. (Attach the radio to the kit before installation) Also, I couldn't get the rear speakers to work and I had to independently wire them to the radio, but it is possible I wired them incorrectly.",Neutral
"I listen to a lot of audio books so I suppose the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro Player seemed like a great Christmas present for me.  And I have to admit that having an mp3 player with more capacity than my PC's old D: drive was a bit of a kick.  The unit is pretty large so it doesn't hide unobtrusively in my jeans pocket like my old Creative MuVo did, but that's ok, I'll clip it to my waistband and hope it stays there.<br />As an engineer, I don't usually RTFM.  I didn't.  The Lyra has a USB I/F and a FAT file system, so Windows 2000 automagically recognizes it as a Removable Disk.  I proceeded to drag and drop 20G of audio books into it, almost 1500 files, into the directory called \MUSIC\.  That's a lot of audio since I listen mostly to low bit rate lectures.  Impressive!<br />A little bit of random button-pushing got the device to profile the contents.  This took a while to complete, but that's fine, consider it part of the initial setup.  After that, some more random button-pushing (a million monkeys, eh?) got some mp3s to play, and even captured my favorite radio show as an mp3. Nice. It was all a bit jumbled in there, though, and sorting by Artist or Artist/Album or even by track title didn't make it possible to locate a 12 lecture series, much less pick out and listen to the 6th lecture.  Hmmm, seems the tags are messed up, I'll have to fix that.  Ok, let's install the software and get serious.<br />Well, that's where the fun began.  The Lyra comes with an application called Lyra DJ.  Lyra DJ has a simple user interface - a big orange button labeled \\""Analyze Device\\"" and a little gray button labeled \\""0 Sets\\"".<br />\\""The main advantage of a simple user interface is that it prevents the user from actually doing anything.\\"" -- banth<br />Push the button and voila'!  Wait several hours for it to analyze the device.  The analysis failed several times.  Ok, I'm a trained professional.  I can handle it.  I deleted most of my audio - a mistake, I realized, but that's what happens when you're wrestling with new hardware at 2AM.  This time the analysis actually completed.  In retrospect, if I had moved the files out of the \MUSIC\ file tree I would have saved myself a lot of hassle.<br />I decided to continue at work, and this is where I realized that having a separate USB cable with a non-standard plug is a disadvantage.  My old Creative MuVo plugged right into the USB port so I didn't have to worry about forgetting the cable.<br />Back at home again I ran the analysis and pushed Lyra DJs little grey button.  It only took a minute or so to create 15 LDJ sets.  The device itself calls these playlists.  Very kewl, *now* I can listen to some audio books... what the....???<br />According to the blurb, Lyra DJ uses \\""advanced acoustical analysis\\"" to \\""create sets of related content\\"".  I'm sure it does, but my tiny engineering mind wasn't able to discern the relationships between the items in the plain vanilla .m3u text-based playlists created by Lyra DJ.  I suspect that if you listen to music and in no particular order, this won't be an issue.<br />I won't bother you with the irritating misspellings on the Lyra DJ app.  Most engineers can't spell anyway.<br />I briefly considered editing the playlists manually, but as I juggled several open files cutting and pasting I realized that I just don't have time to futz with it, especially if I want to load another 18G of audio.  I was going to have to use another app to generate playlists.<br />I also considered modifying the ID tags to enable the RCA Lyra itself to present them in a logical manner.  I don't &$^$ think so.<br />The RCA Lyra also comes bundled with MusicMatch software.  Throw the installation CD away.  Save yourself some trouble and use something already installed on your computer to create playlists.  I settled on WinAmp.  So here's how to do it:<br />Arrange your audio files in a neat, structured manner as subdirectories in the RCA Lyra \MUSIC\ directory.<br />In WinAmp, create a new playlist.<br />Also in WinAmp, Add a folder from your RCA Lyra directory structure to the playlist.  Make sure the files are sorted correctly in WinAmp - if ID tags are messed up the playlist will be scrambled.<br />Still in WinAmp, Save the playlist to the RCA Lyra \lyra_playlists\ directory.<br />From the RCA Lyra menu system, profile the device.<br />It's important to save the playlist to the RCA Lyra so that the .m3u file has the correct paths.<br />Simple, eh?<br />I'm failing to see the benefit of carrying 20G of audio files when a 512M Creative MuVo carries an entire work day of audio.<br />But that's ok, the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro Player is a serious Guy Magnet.<br />Update 1/28/2006:<br />After having used the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro for a year I really have come to like it.
